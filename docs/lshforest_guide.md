# Understanding LSH Forest: A Visual Guide

This guide explains how LSH Forest works in TMAP and helps you choose the right query methods and parameters.

---

## What LSH Forest Does

LSH Forest is an **index structure** for fast approximate nearest neighbor search. It takes MinHash signatures and enables rapid similarity queries.

**The key insight:** Instead of comparing every item to every other item (O(n²)), LSH Forest uses clever hashing to find similar items in O(n log n) time.

```txt
MinHash Signatures
        ↓
    [LSH Forest Index]
        ↓
Fast Neighbor Queries → k-NN Graph → TMAP Layout
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from tmap import MinHash, LSHForest

# 1. Encode your data
mh = MinHash(num_perm=128, seed=42)
signatures = mh.batch_from_binary_array(fingerprints)

# 2. Build the index
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=64)  # d must match num_perm
lsh.batch_add(signatures)
lsh.index()  # Don't forget this!

# 3. Build k-NN graph (main output for TMAP)
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)
```

---

## How LSH Forest Works (Conceptually)

Think of LSH Forest as organizing items into **buckets** based on their hash values.

### The Bucket Analogy

1. **Hashing**: Each signature is split into `l` bands. Each band produces a hash value.
2. **Bucketing**: Items with the same band hash go into the same bucket.
3. **Querying**: To find neighbors, look in buckets where the query item lands.

```txt
Signature (128 values)
    ↓
Split into l=8 bands (16 values each)
    ↓
Band 0: hash → bucket A
Band 1: hash → bucket B
Band 2: hash → bucket C
...
    ↓
Query: check all buckets, collect candidates
```

**Why multiple bands?** More bands = more chances to find similar items, even if they don't match perfectly in any single band.

---

## Parameters

### `d` - Signature Dimensionality

**Must match your MinHash `num_perm`.**

```python
mh = MinHash(num_perm=128)  # Creates 128-dimensional signatures
lsh = LSHForest(d=128)      # d=128 to match
```

### `l` - Number of Prefix Trees (Bands)

Controls the **recall vs speed** tradeoff.

| `l` Value | Recall | Speed | Memory | Best For |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| 8 | Low | Fastest | Low | Quick exploration |
| 32 | Medium | Fast | Medium | Small datasets (<10k) |
| 64 | Good | Good | Good | **Medium datasets (10k-100k)** |
| 128 | High | Slower | High | Large datasets (>100k) |

**Rule of thumb:** Start with `l=64`. Increase if you're missing neighbors.

```python
# For a 50k molecule dataset
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=64)
```

### `store` - Signature Storage

Controls whether signatures are kept in memory after indexing.

| Value | Memory | Capabilities |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `True` (default) | Higher | Full functionality: queries, distances, k-NN graph |
| `False` | Lower | Only LSH queries (no linear scan, no k-NN graph) |

```python
# Memory-constrained: only need approximate queries
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, store=False)

# Full functionality (recommended)
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, store=True)
```

**Note:** `store=False` disables `get_knn_graph()`, `linear_scan()`, `get_distance_by_id()`, etc.

### `weighted` - Weighted MinHash Support

Set to `True` when using `WeightedMinHash` signatures.

```python
# For regular MinHash (binary fingerprints)
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, weighted=False)

# For WeightedMinHash (float vectors)
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, weighted=True)
```

**Important:** Weighted signatures have shape `(d, 2)` vs regular `(d,)`.

## Query Methods: Which One to Use?

LSH Forest provides multiple query methods. Here's when to use each:

### Decision Tree

```txt
What do you need?
│
├─ k-NN graph of ALL points → get_knn_graph() ⭐ MAIN METHOD
│
├─ Query a NEW point (not in index)?
│   │
│   ├─ Need accurate distances? → query_linear_scan()
│   │
│   └─ Just need candidates? → query()
│
└─ Query an EXISTING point (by ID)?
    │
    ├─ Need accurate distances? → query_linear_scan_by_id()
    │
    └─ Just need candidates? → query_by_id()
```

### Method Comparison

| Method | Returns | Accuracy | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| `get_knn_graph(k, kc)` | KNNGraph | High | Fast | **Build TMAP layout** |
| `query_linear_scan(sig, k, kc)` | [(dist, idx), ...] | High | Medium | Query new point |
| `query_linear_scan_by_id(id, k, kc)` | [(dist, idx), ...] | High | Medium | Query existing point |
| `query(sig, k)` | [idx, ...] | Low | Fast | Get candidates only |
| `query_by_id(id, k)` | [idx, ...] | Low | Fast | Get candidates only |
| `linear_scan(sig, indices, k)` | [(dist, idx), ...] | Exact | Varies | Refine candidates |

---

## Method Details

### `get_knn_graph(k, kc)` - The Primary Method

**Use this for building TMAP visualizations.**

```python
# Build k-NN graph for layout
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)

# knn.indices: shape (n_points, k) - neighbor indices
# knn.distances: shape (n_points, k) - distances to neighbors

print(f"Found neighbors for {knn.n_nodes} points")
print(f"Each point has up to {knn.k} neighbors")
```

**Parameters:**

- `k`: Number of neighbors per point
- `kc`: Search quality multiplier (searches `k * kc` candidates, keeps best `k`)

**Returns:** `KNNGraph` object with `indices` and `distances` arrays.

**Note:** Self is excluded from neighbors. Point 0's neighbors won't include 0.

---

### `query_linear_scan(signature, k, kc)` - Query New Point

**For querying a point not in the index.**

```python
# Encode a new molecule
new_fp = load_new_fingerprint()
new_sig = mh.from_binary_array(new_fp)

# Find its neighbors in the indexed set
neighbors = lsh.query_linear_scan(new_sig, k=10, kc=20)

for distance, idx in neighbors:
    print(f"Neighbor {idx}: distance = {distance:.3f}")
```

**How it works:**

1. LSH query finds `k * kc` candidates
2. Linear scan computes exact distances to candidates
3. Returns best `k` sorted by distance

---

### `query_linear_scan_by_id(id, k, kc)` - Query Existing Point

**For querying a point that's already indexed.**

```python
# Find neighbors of point 42
neighbors = lsh.query_linear_scan_by_id(42, k=10, kc=20)

# Self (42) is automatically excluded
for distance, idx in neighbors:
    print(f"Neighbor {idx}: distance = {distance:.3f}")
```

---

### `query(signature, k)` - Fast Approximate Query

**For getting candidate indices without distance computation.**

```python
# Get candidates (no distances, may include false positives)
candidates = lsh.query(signature, k=100)
print(f"Found {len(candidates)} candidates")
```

**Note:** Results are not sorted by distance. Use `linear_scan()` to refine.

---

### `linear_scan(signature, indices, k)` - Refine Candidates

**For computing exact distances on a subset.**

```python
# Get rough candidates
candidates = lsh.query(signature, k=100)

# Refine with exact distances
results = lsh.linear_scan(signature, candidates, k=10)

for distance, idx in results:
    print(f"Neighbor {idx}: distance = {distance:.3f}")
```

---

## Understanding k and kc

These parameters control the **connectivity vs speed** tradeoff.

### `k` - Number of Neighbors

How many neighbors to keep per point.

| k | Effect | Use Case |
|---|--------|----------|
| 5-10 | Sparse graph, may disconnect | Quick exploration |
| 20-30 | **Good connectivity** | Most cases |
| 50-100 | Very dense graph | When connectivity is critical |

**Tip:** If your TMAP shows disconnected clusters (grid of dots), increase `k`.

### `kc` - Search Quality Multiplier

How many candidates to consider before keeping best `k`.

| kc | Candidates Searched | Quality | Speed |
|----|---------------------|---------|-------|
| 10 | k × 10 | Approximate | Fast |
| 50 | k × 50 | Good | Good |
| 100 | k × 100 | High | Slower |

**Why kc matters:** LSH is approximate. Higher `kc` means checking more candidates, increasing the chance of finding true nearest neighbors.

```python
# Fast but may miss some neighbors
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=10)  # Searches 200 candidates

# Thorough search
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=100)  # Searches 2000 candidates
```

---

## Distance Methods

### Static Distance Functions

```python
# Jaccard distance between two signatures
dist = LSHForest.get_distance(sig_a, sig_b)

# Weighted Jaccard distance (for WeightedMinHash)
dist = LSHForest.get_weighted_distance(sig_a, sig_b)
```

### Instance Methods (Require Indexing)

```python
# Distance between indexed points
dist = lsh.get_distance_by_id(0, 1)

# Distances from a signature to ALL indexed points
distances = lsh.get_all_distances(query_signature)
print(distances.shape)  # (n_indexed,)
```

---

## Persistence

Save and load your index to avoid recomputation.

```python
# Save
lsh.save("my_index.pkl")

# Load
lsh = LSHForest.load("my_index.pkl")

# Ready to query immediately
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)
```

**What's saved:**

- All signatures
- Hash band structures
- Configuration (d, l, weighted, store)

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Build Once, Query Many

```python
# Build index (expensive)
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=64)
lsh.batch_add(all_signatures)
lsh.index()
lsh.save("index.pkl")

# Later: load and query (fast)
lsh = LSHForest.load("index.pkl")
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)
```

### Pattern 2: Incremental Updates

```python
# Initial index
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=64)
lsh.batch_add(initial_signatures)
lsh.index()

# Add more data
lsh.batch_add(new_signatures)
lsh.index()  # Must re-index after adding

# Query the full index
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)
```

### Pattern 3: Query New Points

```python
# Build index of known compounds
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=64)
lsh.batch_add(known_signatures)
lsh.index()

# Later: find similar compounds for a new molecule
new_sig = mh.from_binary_array(new_fingerprint)
neighbors = lsh.query_linear_scan(new_sig, k=10, kc=50)
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting to Call `index()`

```python
# ❌ WRONG - index() not called
lsh = LSHForest(d=128)
lsh.batch_add(signatures)
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)  # RuntimeError!

# ✓ Correct
lsh = LSHForest(d=128)
lsh.batch_add(signatures)
lsh.index()  # Don't forget!
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)
```

### 2. Mismatched Dimensions

```python
# ❌ WRONG - d doesn't match signature dimension
mh = MinHash(num_perm=128)
signatures = mh.batch_from_binary_array(fps)  # Shape: (n, 128)

lsh = LSHForest(d=64)  # Wrong! Should be 128
lsh.batch_add(signatures)  # ValueError!

# ✓ Correct
lsh = LSHForest(d=128)  # Match num_perm
```

### 3. Not Re-indexing After Adding

```python
# After adding more data, index is stale
lsh.batch_add(new_signatures)
assert not lsh.is_clean  # True - needs re-indexing

# Re-index before querying
lsh.index()
assert lsh.is_clean  # Now it's clean
```

### 4. Using store=False Then Expecting Full Functionality

```python
# ❌ WRONG - store=False limits functionality
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, store=False)
lsh.batch_add(signatures)
lsh.index()
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)  # ValueError!

# ✓ If you need k-NN graph, use store=True (default)
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, store=True)
```

### 5. Mixing Regular and Weighted Signatures

```python
# ❌ WRONG - weighted mode mismatch
wmh = WeightedMinHash(dim=100, num_perm=128)
sigs = wmh.batch_from_weight_array(weights)  # Shape: (n, 128, 2)

lsh = LSHForest(d=128, weighted=False)  # Wrong!
lsh.batch_add(sigs)  # ValueError!

# ✓ Correct
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, weighted=True)
```

---

## KNNGraph Object

The `get_knn_graph()` method returns a `KNNGraph` object:

```python
knn = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)

# Properties
print(knn.n_nodes)    # Number of points
print(knn.k)          # Neighbors per point

# Arrays
print(knn.indices.shape)    # (n_nodes, k)
print(knn.distances.shape)  # (n_nodes, k)

# Access neighbors of point 0
point_0_neighbors = knn.indices[0]
point_0_distances = knn.distances[0]

# Convert to edge list (for debugging/export)
edge_list = knn.to_edge_list()
```

**Special values:**
- `indices[i, j] == -1`: No valid neighbor (sparse)
- `distances[i, j] >= 2.0`: Invalid distance marker

---

## Performance Tips

### 1. Batch Add Is Faster

```python
# ⚡ Fast
lsh.batch_add(all_signatures)
lsh.index()

# 🐌 Slow
for sig in all_signatures:
    lsh.add(sig)
lsh.index()
```

### 2. Index Once, Query Many

```python
# ⚡ Index once
lsh.index()

# Can query many times without re-indexing
knn1 = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=10, kc=50)
knn2 = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=20, kc=50)
knn3 = lsh.get_knn_graph(k=30, kc=100)
```

### 3. Tune l Based on Dataset Size

```python
# Small dataset: lower l is fine
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=32)  # < 10k points

# Large dataset: higher l for better recall
lsh = LSHForest(d=128, l=128)  # > 100k points
```
